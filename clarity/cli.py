    The problem this exists for: a finished upscale is a *derivative* of a specific version of a

    texture, the row still says `done`, the file is still on disk, and the mod quietly keeps
    serving an upscale of the previous artwork -- forever, because `run` only ever looks at rows
    marked `planned`. There is no error and nothing to notice.

    So: `--stamp` (the default) writes today's hash onto rows that have one missing, and `--check`
    recomputes and reports the difference. Run stamp before a patch and check after it, and the
    delta is exactly the list of textures to redo. `--check --requeue` turns that list back into
    work.

    This is deliberately a standing capability rather than a one-off for a particular patch. 7.56 is
    not the last one -- there is a Gold Saucer patch coming, the typing minigame, regional party
    finder, and hotfixes have a long history of carrying unannounced asset changes along with
    whatever they were actually for. Every one of those is another chance to end up with upscales of
