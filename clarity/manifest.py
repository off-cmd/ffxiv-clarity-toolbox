"""The manifest: every vanilla texture we intend to touch, classified family × role, in sqlite.

Two ways to enumerate, used together:

* **generative** — walk the game's own structure: equipment / accessory / weapon / monster /
  demihuman / human sets by id, `.mdl` material names × `.imc` material variants → `.mtrl` →
  texture paths; UI icons by id probing.  Complete for `chara/` and `ui/icon/` without any
  external list.
* **path list** — a ResLogger `CurrentPathList` (or any text file with one game path per line)
  covers `bg/`, `bgcommon/`, `ui/uld/` and everything else.  `clarity plan --pathlist FILE`.

Classification (KB 07 §5, KB 08):

    role      suffix                      what the pipeline does
    id        _id / _index                nothing — discrete colour-set selector, never resampled
    normal    _n / _norm                  BC1-clean → RG normal model → renormalise; alpha (opacity) as a scalar
    mask      _m / _mask                  each channel as an independent scalar
    color     _d / _s / _b / _base / _e   colour model + average-colour fix
    icon      ui/icon/**                  RGBA, alpha-aware, pixel-art model
    ui        ui/uld/**, ui/other         RGBA, alpha-aware

# The useful distinction is the one Kartoffels draws: a wall you stand two feet from in your own
# house is looked at for hours, and a cliff face three hundred yalms away is not. But his categories
# straddle `bg/` and `bgcommon/`, and those are SEPARATE SQPACK ARCHIVES -- category 0x02 and 0x01,
# different .dat/.index files, different repos -- so merging them into one family would put paths
# from two archives behind one policy and one mod, and any future per-archive operation would have
# to unpick it. So the split happens INSIDE each prefix:
#
#   bg/<repo>/<zone>/<kind>/...     kind is segment 3: fld dun twn btl evt ang pvp ... and hou / ind
#   bgcommon/<group>/<sub>/...      group is segment 1: hou (indoor outdoor craft dyna common),
#                                   world (cut evt air sip emp itm tbx ...), mji, nature ...
#
# The families carry what POLICY and the Penumbra mod list need; the finer level goes in `part`,
# which the schema already has and which nothing was putting anything in for these two prefixes.
# That is why bgcommon-hou is one family rather than four: indoor/outdoor/craft/dyna want the same
# tier as each other, and `part` already distinguishes them for querying and for --family filtering.

    #
    # THE BODY SCAN USED TO BE `range(1, 60)` WITH `if b > 2: break`, AND BOTH HALVES WERE WRONG.
    #
    # The cap excluded every body numbered 60 or above outright -- w1851 runs to b0117 in the
    # 2026.09.01 client and w9001 to b0468 -- and the break stopped the scan at the first gap, so a
    # set whose numbering is not contiguous from b0001 was truncated at its first hole. w0371 has
    # bodies 2, 3, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19, 40: the loop saw b0002 and b0003, hit the gap at b0004 and
    # stopped. w2651's lowest body is b0011, so the loop hit `b > 2` at b0003 and produced NOTHING
    # for that set at all.
    #
    # The path list papered over most of it -- ResLogger sees whatever anyone loaded -- which is why
    # this only surfaced as nine weapon models missing from a 46,451-path comparison. It was never
    # about those nine models' material shape (the "no _d" theory does not survive contact with the
    # data: n/m/id is the MOST COMMON shape in the manifest, 2,102 of 4,913 weapon model dirs).
    #
    # So: probe a short prefix to decide whether the set exists at all, then scan the set's whole
    # range with no early exit. PROBE has to clear the highest first-body in the client, which is
    # b0011 (one weapon set); 24 leaves room. SCAN covers b0468. The lone w2701 b9998 is left out
    # deliberately -- scanning to 10,000 for one path costs 10 million index lookups.
