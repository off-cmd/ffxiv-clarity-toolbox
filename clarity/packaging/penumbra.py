"""Penumbra packaging: one mod per family group, a single-select "Tier" group whose options are
the tiers that were produced. Output textures are written by `run` straight into
`<out>/<mod>/files/<tier>/<game path>`, so packing only writes the JSON.

Also merges the new mods into the XIVPenumbra layout: `sort_order.json` paths under

    THE TIER GROUP IS SINGLE-SELECT, SO AN OPTION IS THE WHOLE MOD, NOT A LAYER. Selecting "4×"
    applies exactly that option's Files and nothing else -- so listing only the textures that
    literally reached 4× meant the best-looking option had the WORST coverage.

    It bites wherever a family's cap is below its sources. `roles.top_tier` halves the scale while
    the source edge exceeds the cap, so with equipment capped at 1024 a 1024px texture produces
    4x/2x/native and a 2048px one produces native ONLY. Picking 4× -- which is the default, being
    last -- then left every 2048px gear texture pointing at vanilla, while the "Native" option
    upscaled it. Same for a 2048px wall under `bg` (cap 1024) in the World mod.

    So each option now falls back per texture to the highest tier that texture actually produced at
    or below the one asked for. "4×" means "the best I made for each texture, capped at 4×", which
    is what a single-select list of qualities has to mean.
