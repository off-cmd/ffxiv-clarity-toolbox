    A mask is typically three independent scalars (specular power, roughness, AO).
    Each channel must be run independently through the model so it does not bleed
    into its neighbors. This is executed as a batch of three model calls.

    Args:
        engine: The neural network processing engine.
        rgba: The source image array as uint8.
        scale: The integer scaling factor (e.g., 2, 4).
        src_fmt: The original BC compression format (e.g., "BC1", "BC7").
        family: The resource family (e.g., "equipment", "monster").
