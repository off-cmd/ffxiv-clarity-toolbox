"""Sprite rectangles for `ui/uld/*.tex`, and a per-part upscale that does not bleed across them.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A UI .tex is an ATLAS: many unrelated sprites stitched into one sheet, and the
sheets are packed with NO GUTTER. JobHudXBM1 has 93 abutting pairs among 49 parts; JobHudXBM0 has
286 among 108. Concretely, parts 37 and 38 -- the Sunstrider and Moonstalker halves of the
Beastmaster wheel -- sit at x=250 and x=307, each 56 wide, so they share an edge, and that edge is
the exact pixel column the widget draws down the middle of the gauge.

Upscaling the sheet as one image gives any model with a receptive field wider than a pixel the
chance to mix each sprite into its neighbour across those seams. The artefact then lands on sprite
EDGES, which is where UI art is looked at hardest, and it is invisible in the sheet -- you only see
it once the game slices the rectangle back out.

WHAT THIS DOES. Every part is upscaled from its own crop, with reflect padding around it, and
composited back at exactly its rectangle times the tier scale. The scale is an integer, so
(u, v, w, h) maps to (Su, Sv, Sw, Sh) with no rounding and the repacked sheet is addressed correctly
by the .uld the game already ships -- which is essential, because the .uld is NOT modified and every
consumer reads those coordinates.

Reflect padding rather than zero or edge: it gives the model plausible signal outside the sprite
without inventing a hard border (zeros) or a smear (edge replication), and whatever it makes of that
padding is cropped away before compositing.

Pixels covered by no part -- the packing waste between sprites -- keep the whole-sheet upscale. The
game never samples them, so what happens there does not matter, but leaving them filled means the
output is still a sensible image to look at.

OVERLAPPING PARTS ARE NORMAL, AND ORDER RESOLVES THEM. Some sheets define a large rectangle with
smaller ones inside it. Compositing largest-first lets the small, specific part win the pixels it
shares, which is the one the game slices out at the tighter coordinates.

SHEETS ARE SHARED, SO NAME MATCHING ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. `jobhudxbm0.uld` carries 108 parts across
FOUR sheets -- JobHudNumBg, JobHudSMN1, JobHudXBM0 and Parameter_Gauge -- of which only 16 are cut
from JobHudXBM0 itself. Parameter_Gauge.tex is described entirely by other widgets' ULDs, so looking
only at `parameter_gauge.uld` would leave the single most-shared sheet in the HUD on the whole-sheet
path. `build_index` therefore loads a whole set of ULDs and keys the rectangles by the sheet each
part actually names; `rects_for` falls back to the same-stem ULD when no index is supplied.

sqpack is a hash index with no directory listing, so the set of ULDs to load has to come from
somewhere -- the caller passes the stems it knows about, which for `clarity run` is every ui/uld row
in the manifest.

    sheet's outer edge. For a part in the middle of a sheet there is no shortfall, so all 8 pixels
    of context were the NEIGHBOURING SPRITE: unrelated artwork, abutting with no gutter, which is
    the one thing this module exists to keep out. Cropping the model's output back to the rectangle
