"""Every path Penumbra is handed must be ASCII.

The game's loader reads mod paths in the system ANSI code page: the em dash in
"Clarity — Gear" became "Clarity â€” Gear", every redirect resolved to a folder that did
not exist, and every character in view went invisible. The header of penumbra.py records
the incident. Option *labels* live inside UTF-8 JSON and are display-only, so "2×" there
is fine; mod names, folder names and sort-order paths are not.
